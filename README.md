# Overview

My final Project will be to render molecules in 2D and 3D forms. I will include:
1) Ability to add any type of element from the periodic table
2) Create new Molecules by making bonds between user created atoms
3) Ability to translate and rotate
4) Convert a 2D representation of Atoms and Molecules into there 3D representations

# Weekly Breakdown
1. Week 1: Finish 2D MoleBuilding
    * limit number of bonds depending on current atom valency
    * limit the distance the user can pull atoms apart when bonded
2. Week 2: Finish search functionality
    * by CID
    * SMILES
3. Week 3: clean angles function.
    * when the user wants to clean up angles between bonds of the molecule based on hybridization
4. Week 4: convert 2D to 3D molecule
5. Week: finish up anything that I had troubles with

# Tools

* Framework: Android Studio
* Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) library
